# celeroncoder's Component

Welcome to **celeroncoder's [shadcn-ui/cli](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) compatible components registry**!

I'm [Khushal](https://celeroncoder.com), and this project aims to streamline the development process by providing complex, reusable UI components that can be added to your projects with minimal effort, basically a **collection of _components gist_ dump thing**.

## Why this exists

I often find myself reusing similar UI components across various projects. Instead of rewriting them every time, I built this registry to enable a seamless integration with a single command or click. Unlike a traditional component library, this is a curated set of specific, pre-built components that solve recurring UI challenges.

If you're a developer looking to save time while maintaining flexibility, you're in the right place.
